`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Taxes

You are going to the International Personal Tax meeting and your proposal is: every individual with income higher than 3000 must pay a tax to the government, which is 10% of his/her income.  
  
Show the name and the tax value of each person who earns more than 3000, with two decimal places of precision.

## Schema

people  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | integer  
name | varchar  
salary | numeric  
  
## Tables

people  **id** | **name** | **salary**  
---|---|---  
1 | James M. Tabarez | 883  
2 | Rafael T. Hendon | 4281  
3 | Linda J. Gardner | 4437  
4 | Nicholas J. Conn | 8011  
5 | Karol A. Morales | 2508  
6 | Lolita S. Graves | 8709  
  
## Output Sample

**name** |  **tax******  
---|---  
Rafael T. Hendon | 428.10  
Linda J. Gardner | 443.70  
Nicholas J. Conn | 801.10  
Lolita S. Graves | 870.90

---

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Filter people with salary > 3000
2. Calculate 10% tax on their salary
3. Format the tax to 2 decimal places
4. Return name and tax columns

Let me analyze the data:
- James M. Tabarez: 883 (≤ 3000, excluded)
- Rafael T. Hendon: 4281 (> 3000, tax = 428.10)
- Linda J. Gardner: 4437 (> 3000, tax = 443.70)
- Nicholas J. Conn: 8011 (> 3000, tax = 801.10)
- Karol A. Morales: 2508 (≤ 3000, excluded)
- Lolita S. Graves: 8709 (> 3000, tax = 870.90)

Here's the SQL query:

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    ROUND(salary * 0.10, 2) AS tax
FROM people
WHERE salary > 3000;
```

This query:

1. **Filters** people with `salary > 3000` using the WHERE clause
2. **Calculates tax** by multiplying salary by 0.10 (10%)
3. **Rounds to 2 decimal places** using `ROUND(salary * 0.10, 2)`
4. **Selects** only the required columns: `name` and `tax`

The query will return exactly the expected output with the four people who earn more than 3000 and their corresponding tax amounts formatted to two decimal places.
