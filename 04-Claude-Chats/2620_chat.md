`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Orders in First Half

The company's financial audit is asking us for a report for the first half of 2016. Then display the customers name and order number for customers who placed orders in the first half of 2016.  
  
## Schema

customers  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
name | character varying (255)  
street | character varying (255)  
city | character varying (255)  
state | char (2)  
credit_limit | numeric  
orders  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
orders_date | date (ISO/YMD)  
id_customers (FK) | numeric  
  
## Tables

customers  **id** | **name** | **street** | **city** | **state** | **credit_limit**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | Nicolas Diogo Cardoso | Acesso Um | Porto Alegre | RS | 475  
2 | Cecília Olivia Rodrigues | Rua Sizuka Usuy | Cianorte | PR | 3170  
3 | Augusto Fernando Carlos Eduardo Cardoso | Rua Baldomiro Koerich | Palhoça | SC | 1067  
4 | Nicolas Diogo Cardoso | Acesso Um | Porto Alegre | RS | 475  
5 | Sabrina Heloisa Gabriela Barros | Rua Engenheiro Tito Marques Fernandes | Porto Alegre | RS | 4312  
6 | Joaquim Diego Lorenzo Araújo | Rua Vitorino | Novo Hamburgo | RS | 2314  
orders  **id** | **orders_date** | **id_customers**  
---|---|---  
1 | 2016-05-13 | 3  
2 | 2016-01-12 | 2  
3 | 2016-04-18 | 5  
4 | 2016-09-07 | 4  
5 | 2016-02-13 | 6  
6 | 2016-08-05 | 3  
  
## Output Sample

**name** | **id**  
---|---  
Augusto Fernando Carlos Eduardo Cardoso | 1  
Cecília Olivia Rodrigues | 2  
Sabrina Heloisa Gabriela Barros | 3  
Joaquim Diego Lorenzo Araújo | 5

---

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find orders placed in the first half of 2016 (January 1 - June 30, 2016)
2. Join with customers to get customer names
3. Return customer name and order id
4. Based on the output sample, it appears the results should be ordered by order id

Let me analyze the data:
- First half of 2016 orders: ids 1, 2, 3, 5 (dates: 2016-05-13, 2016-01-12, 2016-04-18, 2016-02-13)
- Orders 4 and 6 are in the second half (2016-09-07, 2016-08-05)

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.id
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.id_customers = c.id
WHERE o.orders_date >= '2016-01-01' 
  AND o.orders_date <= '2016-06-30'
ORDER BY o.id;
```

This query:
- Joins the `orders` and `customers` tables on the foreign key relationship
- Filters orders to only include those in the first half of 2016 (January 1 through June 30)
- Returns the customer name and order id as specified
- Orders the results by order id to match the expected output format

The result matches the expected output:
- Augusto Fernando Carlos Eduardo Cardoso | 1
- Cecília Olivia Rodrigues | 2  
- Sabrina Heloisa Gabriela Barros | 3
- Joaquim Diego Lorenzo Araújo | 5
