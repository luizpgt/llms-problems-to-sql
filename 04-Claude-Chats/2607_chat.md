`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Providers' City in Alphabetical Order

Every month the company asks for a report from the cities that providers are registered. So, do a query that returns all the cities of the providers, but in alphabetical order.  
  
OBS: You must not show repeated cities.

## Schema

providers  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
name | varchar  
street | varchar  
city | varchar  
state | char  
  
## Tables

providers  **id** | **name** | **street** | **city** | **state**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 | Henrique | Av Brasil | Rio de Janeiro | RJ  
2 | Marcelo Augusto | Rua Imigrantes | Belo Horizonte | MG  
3 | Caroline Silva | Av S達o Paulo | Salvador | BA  
4 | Guilerme Staff | Rua Central | Porto Alegre | RS  
5 | Isabela Moraes | Av Juiz Grande | Curitiba | PR  
6 | Francisco Accerr | Av Paulista | S達o Paulo | SP  
  
## Output Sample

**city**  
---  
Belo Horizonte  
Curitiba  
Porto Alegre  
Rio de Janeiro  
Salvador  
S達o Paulo

---

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Select the `city` column from the `providers` table
2. Remove duplicates (DISTINCT)
3. Order the results alphabetically

Here's the SQL query:

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM providers
ORDER BY city;
```

This query:

- Uses `SELECT DISTINCT city` to get unique city names (no duplicates)
- From the `providers` table
- Orders the results alphabetically with `ORDER BY city`

The query will return exactly the expected output:
- Belo Horizonte
- Curitiba  
- Porto Alegre
- Rio de Janeiro
- Salvador
- S達o Paulo

The solution is simple, efficient, and meets all the requirements: it shows all provider cities without repetition in alphabetical order.
