`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Customer Address

The company will make an event celebrating the 20th anniversary of the market, and for that we will make a great celebration in the city of Porto Alegre. We also invite all our customers who are enrolled in this city.

Your job is in having the names and addresses of customers who live in 'Porto Alegre', to deliver the invitations personally.

## Schema

customers  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
name | varchar  
street | varchar  
city | varchar  
state | char  
credit_limit | number  
  
## Tables

customers  **id** | **name** | **street** | **city** | **state** | **credit_limit**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | Pedro Augusto da Rocha | Rua Pedro Carlos Hoffman | Porto Alegre | RS | 700,00  
2 | Antonio Carlos Mamel | Av. Pinheiros | Belo Horizonte | MG | 3500,50  
3 | Luiza Augusta Mhor | Rua Salto Grande | Niteroi | RJ | 4000,00  
4 | Jane Ester | Av 7 de setembro | Erechim | RS | 800,00  
5 | Marcos Antônio dos Santos | Av Farrapos | Porto Alegre | RS | 4250,25  
  
## Output Sample

**name** |  **street******  
---|---  
Pedro Augusto da Rocha | Rua Pedro Carlos Hoffman  
Marcos Antônio dos Santos | Av Farrapos

---

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Select customers who live in 'Porto Alegre'
2. Return only their names and street addresses
3. Match the expected output format

Here's the SQL query:

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
SELECT name, street
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Porto Alegre';
```

This query:

1. **Selects the required columns**: `name` and `street` as specified in the output sample
2. **Filters by city**: Uses `WHERE city = 'Porto Alegre'` to get only customers from Porto Alegre
3. **Matches the expected output**: Returns the two customers (Pedro Augusto da Rocha and Marcos Antônio dos Santos) who live in Porto Alegre with their respective street addresses

The query is simple, efficient, and directly addresses the problem requirements without unnecessary complexity.
