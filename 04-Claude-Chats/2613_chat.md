`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Cheap Movies

In the past the studio has made an event where several movies were on sale, we want to know what movies these were.  
  
Your job to help us is to select the ID and name of movies whose price is less than 2.00.

## Schema

movies  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
name | varchar  
id_prices (FK) | numeric  
prices  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
categorie | varchar  
value | numeric  
  
## Tables

movies  **id** | **name** | **id_prices**  
---|---|---  
1 | Batman | 3  
2 | The Battle of the Dark River | 3  
3 | White Duck | 5  
4 | Breaking Barriers | 4  
5 | The Two Hours | 2  
prices  **id** | **categorie** | **value**  
---|---|---  
1 | Releases | 3.50  
2 | Bronze Seal | 2.00  
3 | Silver Seal | 2.50  
4 | Gold Seal | 3.00  
5 | Promotion | 1.50  
  
## Output Sample

**id** | **name**  
---|---  
3 | White Duck

---

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find movies with prices less than 2.00
2. Join the `movies` and `prices` tables using the foreign key relationship
3. Return only the `id` and `name` of qualifying movies

Let me analyze the data:
- Movies table has `id_prices` as a foreign key to `prices.id`
- I need to check `prices.value < 2.00`
- From the sample data, only "White Duck" (id=3) has `id_prices=5`, which corresponds to "Promotion" with `value=1.50`

Here's the SQL query:

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
SELECT m.id, m.name
FROM movies m
JOIN prices p ON m.id_prices = p.id
WHERE p.value < 2.00;
```

This query:

1. **Joins** the `movies` table with the `prices` table using the foreign key relationship (`m.id_prices = p.id`)
2. **Filters** for movies where the price value is less than 2.00 (`p.value < 2.00`)
3. **Selects** only the required columns: movie `id` and `name`

The result matches the expected output - only "White Duck" (id=3) qualifies since it has a price of 1.50, which is less than 2.00.
