`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Cearense Championship

The Soccer Cearense Championship attracts thousands of fans every year and you work for a newspaper and are in charge to calculate the score table. Show a table with the following rows: the team name, number of matches, victories, defeats, draws, and scores. Knowing that the score is calculated with each victory valuing 3 points, draw valuing 1 and defeat valuing 0. In the end, show your table with the score from the highest to the lowest.  
  
## Schema

teams  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | integer  
name | varchar (50)  
matches  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | integer  
team_1 (FK) | integer  
team_2 (FK) | integer  
team_1_goals | integer  
team_2_goals | integer  
  
## Tables

teams  **id** | **name**  
---|---  
1 | CEARA  
2 | FORTALEZA  
3 | GUARANY DE SOBRAL  
4 | FLORESTA  
matches  **id** | **team_1** | **team_2** | **team_1_goals** | **team_2_goals**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 4  
2 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1  
3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 0  
4 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 1  
5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0  
6 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1  
  
## Output Sample

**name** | **matches** | **victories** | **defeats** | **draws** | **score**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
CEARA | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  
FORTALEZA | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  
FLORESTA | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3  
GUARANY DE SOBRAL | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to calculate statistics for each team based on their match results. Each team can appear as either `team_1` or `team_2` in matches, so I need to handle both cases.

Let me break down the approach:
1. For each team, find all matches where they participated (as team_1 or team_2)
2. Calculate victories, defeats, and draws based on goal comparisons
3. Calculate total score (3 points for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)
4. Order by score descending

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
WITH team_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    t.name,
    -- Count total matches for each team
    COUNT(*) as matches,
    -- Count victories: when team_1 and team_1_goals > team_2_goals, or when team_2 and team_2_goals > team_1_goals
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN (m.team_1 = t.id AND m.team_1_goals > m.team_2_goals) OR 
           (m.team_2 = t.id AND m.team_2_goals > m.team_1_goals) 
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END) as victories,
    -- Count defeats: when team_1 and team_1_goals < team_2_goals, or when team_2 and team_2_goals < team_1_goals
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN (m.team_1 = t.id AND m.team_1_goals < m.team_2_goals) OR 
           (m.team_2 = t.id AND m.team_2_goals < m.team_1_goals) 
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END) as defeats,
    -- Count draws: when goals are equal
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN m.team_1_goals = m.team_2_goals 
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END) as draws
  FROM teams t
  JOIN matches m ON (t.id = m.team_1 OR t.id = m.team_2)
  GROUP BY t.id, t.name
)
SELECT 
  name,
  matches,
  victories,
  defeats,
  draws,
  -- Calculate score: 3 points for victory, 1 for draw, 0 for defeat
  (victories * 3 + draws * 1) as score
FROM team_stats
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

This query solves the problem by:

1. **Using a CTE (Common Table Expression)** to first calculate the basic statistics for each team
2. **Joining teams with matches** where the team appears as either `team_1` or `team_2`
3. **Calculating victories** by checking if:
   - Team is `team_1` and `team_1_goals > team_2_goals`, OR
   - Team is `team_2` and `team_2_goals > team_1_goals`
4. **Calculating defeats** by checking if:
   - Team is `team_1` and `team_1_goals < team_2_goals`, OR  
   - Team is `team_2` and `team_2_goals < team_1_goals`
5. **Calculating draws** when `team_1_goals = team_2_goals`
6. **Computing the final score** as `victories × 3 + draws × 1`
7. **Ordering by score descending** as requested

The query handles the fact that each team can appear in either position in a match and correctly counts all statistics. The final result matches the expected output format with all required columns.
