You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Richard's Multiverse

Richard is a famous scientist because of his multiverse theory, where he describes every hypothetical set of parallel universes by means of a database. Thanks to that you now have a job..  
  
As your first task, you must select every Richard from dimensions C875 and C774, together with its existence probability (the famous factor N) with three decimal places of precision.

Remember that the N factor is calculated by multiplying the **omega** value by 1,618. The data must be sorted by the least **omega** value.

## Schema

dimensions  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
name | varchar  
life_registry  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | numeric  
name | varchar  
omega | numeric  
dimensions_id (FK) | numeric  
  
## Tables

dimensions  **id** | **name**  
---|---  
1 | C774  
2 | C784  
3 | C794  
4 | C824  
5 | C875  
life_registry  **id** | **name** | **omega** | **dimensions_id**  
---|---|---|---  
1 | Richard Postman | 5.6 | 2  
2 | Simple Jelly | 1.4 | 1  
3 | Richard Gran Master | 2.5 | 1  
4 | Richard Turing | 6.4 | 4  
5 | Richard Strall | 1.0 | 3  
  
## Output Sample

**name** | **The N Factor**  
---|---  
Richard Gran Master | 4.045

---

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Select Richards from dimensions C875 and C774
2. Calculate the N factor (omega * 1.618) with 3 decimal places
3. Sort by least omega value
4. Return name and "The N Factor" columns

Let me analyze the data:
- Dimension C774 has id = 1
- Dimension C875 has id = 5
- From the life_registry table, I need to find records where:
  - name contains "Richard" 
  - dimensions_id is 1 (C774) or 5 (C875)

From the data:
- Richard Gran Master (omega: 2.5, dimensions_id: 1) - this is in C774
- No Richards appear to be in dimension C875 (id=5) based on the sample data

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
SELECT 
    lr.name,
    ROUND(lr.omega * 1.618, 3) AS "The N Factor"
FROM life_registry lr
INNER JOIN dimensions d ON lr.dimensions_id = d.id
WHERE lr.name LIKE '%Richard%'
    AND d.name IN ('C875', 'C774')
ORDER BY lr.omega ASC;
```

This SQL query will:

1. **JOIN** the `life_registry` and `dimensions` tables to connect records with their dimension names
2. **Filter** for records where:
   - The name contains "Richard" (using `LIKE '%Richard%'`)
   - The dimension name is either 'C875' or 'C774'
3. **Calculate** the N Factor by multiplying omega by 1.618 and rounding to 3 decimal places
4. **Sort** results by omega value in ascending order (least first)
5. **Return** only the name and calculated N Factor columns as specified

Based on the sample data provided, this should return:
- Richard Gran Master with N Factor of 4.045 (2.5 * 1.618 = 4.045)

The query is efficient as it uses a single JOIN and appropriate WHERE conditions to filter the data before processing.
