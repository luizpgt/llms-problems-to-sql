You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

An expert solution to the "Orders in First Half" problem.

### Method

To solve this problem, we need to retrieve the customer's name and the order number. This requires joining the `customers` and `orders` tables on the customer ID. After joining, we must filter these results to include only the orders placed in the first half of 2016. The first half of the year is defined as the period from January 1st to June 30th.

Here is the step-by-step logic for the query:

1.  **`SELECT c.name, o.id`**: Select the customer's name from the `customers` table (aliased as `c`) and the order's id from the `orders` table (aliased as `o`).
2.  **`FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.id_customers`**: Join the two tables. The `customers` table is connected to the `orders` table through the foreign key `id_customers`, which corresponds to the primary key `id` in the `customers` table.
3.  **`WHERE o.orders_date >= '2016-01-01' AND o.orders_date <= '2016-06-30'`**: Filter the joined records to keep only those where the `orders_date` falls within the first six months of 2016.

This approach directly filters the orders to the specified date range and then joins to get the customer names, resulting in an efficient and accurate query.

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.id
FROM
  customers c
  INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.id_customers
WHERE
  o.orders_date BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2016-06-30';
```
