`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Most Frequent

Given a _single-column table_ with integers values, which is the most frequent value, in other words, the statistical mode of the values?  
  
## Schema

value_table  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
amount | integer  
  
## Tables

value_table  **amount**

## Output Sample

**most_frequent_value**

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

Of course\! As a PostgreSQL SQL expert, here is a correct, efficient, and readable query to solve the problem.

### Solution

This query uses the `MODE()` aggregate function, which is a clean and efficient way to find the most frequent value in a set.

```sql
SELECT
  MODE() WITHIN GROUP (
    ORDER BY
      amount
  ) AS most_frequent_value
FROM
  value_table;
```
