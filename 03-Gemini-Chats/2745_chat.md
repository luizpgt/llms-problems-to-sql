`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Taxes

You are going to the International Personal Tax meeting and your proposal is: every individual with income higher than 3000 must pay a tax to the government, which is 10% of his/her income.  
  
Show the name and the tax value of each person who earns more than 3000, with two decimal places of precision.

## Schema

people  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | integer  
name | varchar  
salary | numeric  
  
## Tables

people  **id** | **name** | **salary**  
---|---|---  
1 | James M. Tabarez | 883  
2 | Rafael T. Hendon | 4281  
3 | Linda J. Gardner | 4437  
4 | Nicholas J. Conn | 8011  
5 | Karol A. Morales | 2508  
6 | Lolita S. Graves | 8709  
  
## Output Sample

**name** |  **tax******  
---|---  
Rafael T. Hendon | 428.10  
Linda J. Gardner | 443.70  
Nicholas J. Conn | 801.10  
Lolita S. Graves | 870.90

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

An elegant and effective solution can be achieved with a straightforward query. We'll select the person's name and calculate 10% of their salary. To ensure we only consider those with an income above 3000, we'll use a `WHERE` clause. Finally, the result is formatted to two decimal places as required.

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  ROUND(salary * 0.1, 2) AS tax
FROM
  people
WHERE
  salary > 3000;
```
