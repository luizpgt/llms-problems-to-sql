`SEP -prompt-`

You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with solving competitive SQL query problems with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* A **table data** with all the data on database.
* The expected **output format/sample**.

Your goal is to write a **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query** that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Cearense Championship

The Soccer Cearense Championship attracts thousands of fans every year and you work for a newspaper and are in charge to calculate the score table. Show a table with the following rows: the team name, number of matches, victories, defeats, draws, and scores. Knowing that the score is calculated with each victory valuing 3 points, draw valuing 1 and defeat valuing 0. In the end, show your table with the score from the highest to the lowest.  
  
## Schema

teams  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | integer  
name | varchar (50)  
matches  **Column** | **Type**  
---|---  
id (PK) | integer  
team_1 (FK) | integer  
team_2 (FK) | integer  
team_1_goals | integer  
team_2_goals | integer  
  
## Tables

teams  **id** | **name**  
---|---  
1 | CEARA  
2 | FORTALEZA  
3 | GUARANY DE SOBRAL  
4 | FLORESTA  
matches  **id** | **team_1** | **team_2** | **team_1_goals** | **team_2_goals**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 4  
2 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1  
3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 0  
4 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 1  
5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0  
6 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1  
  
## Output Sample

**name** | **matches** | **victories** | **defeats** | **draws** | **score**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
CEARA | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  
FORTALEZA | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  
FLORESTA | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3  
GUARANY DE SOBRAL | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0

**Notes:**

* Use standard SQL syntax or PostgreSQL syntax.
* Avoid unnecessary joins or subqueries.
* Return only the columns specified in the output.
* Ensure no duplicate rows if the problem requires uniqueness.
* Order results if explicitly requested.

`SEP -response-`

An elegant and effective way to solve this problem is to first consolidate all the match results for each team into a unified view. Since a team can appear as `team_1` or `team_2`, we use `UNION ALL` to create a list of all games played, from the perspective of each individual team.

With this consolidated data, we can then group by each team and aggregate the results. We use `COUNT(*)` to get the number of matches played. For victories, defeats, and draws, we use `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to count each outcome based on the goals scored for and against.

Finally, we calculate the score based on the aggregated victories and draws and join this result with the `teams` table to get the team names. The entire result set is then ordered by the `score` in descending order to produce the final leaderboard.

```sql
WITH all_team_matches AS (
    -- Select matches where the team is team_1
    SELECT
        m.team_1 AS team_id,
        m.team_1_goals AS goals_for,
        m.team_2_goals AS goals_against
    FROM
        matches AS m
    UNION ALL
    -- Select matches where the team is team_2 and unify with the above
    SELECT
        m.team_2 AS team_id,
        m.team_2_goals AS goals_for,
        m.team_1_goals AS goals_against
    FROM
        matches AS m
),
-- Calculate the statistics for each team
team_stats AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        COUNT(team_id) AS matches,
        SUM(CASE WHEN goals_for > goals_against THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS victories,
        SUM(CASE WHEN goals_for < goals_against THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS defeats,
        SUM(CASE WHEN goals_for = goals_against THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS draws
    FROM
        all_team_matches
    GROUP BY
        team_id
)
-- Select the final results and join to get team names
SELECT
    t.name,
    s.matches,
    s.victories,
    s.defeats,
    s.draws,
    (s.victories * 3 + s.draws) AS score
FROM
    team_stats AS s
JOIN
    teams AS t ON s.team_id = t.id
ORDER BY
    score DESC;
```
