**Now, solve the following problem:**

# Cearense Championship

The Soccer Cearense Championship attracts thousands of fans every year and you work for a newspaper and are in charge to calculate the score table. Show a table with the following rows: the team name, number of matches, victories, defeats, draws, and scores. Knowing that the score is calculated with each victory valuing 3 points, draw valuing 1 and defeat valuing 0. In the end, show your table with the score from the highest to the lowest.

`SEP -response-`

Looking at this problem, I need to calculate statistics for each team based on their match results. Each team can appear as either `team_1` or `team_2` in matches, so I need to handle both cases.

Let me break down the approach:
1. For each team, find all matches where they participated (as team_1 or team_2)
2. Calculate victories, defeats, and draws based on goal comparisons
3. Calculate total score (3 points for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)
4. Order by score descending

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
WITH team_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    t.name,
    -- Count total matches for each team
    COUNT(*) as matches,
    -- Count victories: when team_1 and team_1_goals > team_2_goals, or when team_2 and team_2_goals > team_1_goals
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN (m.team_1 = t.id AND m.team_1_goals > m.team_2_goals) OR 
           (m.team_2 = t.id AND m.team_2_goals > m.team_1_goals) 
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END) as victories,
    -- Count defeats: when team_1 and team_1_goals < team_2_goals, or when team_2 and team_2_goals < team_1_goals
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN (m.team_1 = t.id AND m.team_1_goals < m.team_2_goals) OR 
           (m.team_2 = t.id AND m.team_2_goals < m.team_1_goals) 
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END) as defeats,
    -- Count draws: when goals are equal
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN m.team_1_goals = m.team_2_goals 
      THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END) as draws
  FROM teams t
  JOIN matches m ON (t.id = m.team_1 OR t.id = m.team_2)
  GROUP BY t.id, t.name
)
SELECT 
  name,
  matches,
  victories,
  defeats,
  draws,
  -- Calculate score: 3 points for victory, 1 for draw, 0 for defeat
  (victories * 3 + draws * 1) as score
FROM team_stats
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

This query solves the problem by:

1. **Using a CTE (Common Table Expression)** to first calculate the basic statistics for each team
2. **Joining teams with matches** where the team appears as either `team_1` or `team_2`
3. **Calculating victories** by checking if:
   - Team is `team_1` and `team_1_goals > team_2_goals`, OR
   - Team is `team_2` and `team_2_goals > team_1_goals`
4. **Calculating defeats** by checking if:
   - Team is `team_1` and `team_1_goals < team_2_goals`, OR  
   - Team is `team_2` and `team_2_goals < team_1_goals`
5. **Calculating draws** when `team_1_goals = team_2_goals`
6. **Computing the final score** as `victories × 3 + draws × 1`
7. **Ordering by score descending** as requested

The query handles the fact that each team can appear in either position in a match and correctly counts all statistics. The final result matches the expected output format with all required columns.

The platform I'm using say this query returns the answer with 0% error. It means there is a small error in the result of this query compared to the expected result given on the first prompt. This is the output on my platform:

could you please revise the last prompt and your response and provide me a new correct one

`SEP -response-`

Looking at the error, let me carefully trace through the expected output to identify the issue.

Let me analyze the matches for each team:

**CEARA (id=1):**
- Match 1: FLORESTA(4) 0 vs CEARA(1) 4 → CEARA wins
- Match 3: CEARA(1) 3 vs GUARANY(3) 0 → CEARA wins  
- Match 5: CEARA(1) 0 vs FORTALEZA(2) 0 → Draw

**FORTALEZA (id=2):**
- Match 2: GUARANY(3) 0 vs FORTALEZA(2) 1 → FORTALEZA wins
- Match 5: CEARA(1) 0 vs FORTALEZA(2) 0 → Draw
- Match 6: FORTALEZA(2) 2 vs FLORESTA(4) 1 → FORTALEZA wins

I think the issue might be with how I'm handling the CASE statements or the logic. Let me rewrite the query with a clearer approach:

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
WITH team_matches AS (
  -- Get all matches for each team, normalizing the data
  SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.name,
    CASE 
      WHEN m.team_1 = t.id THEN m.team_1_goals
      ELSE m.team_2_goals
    END as team_goals,
    CASE 
      WHEN m.team_1 = t.id THEN m.team_2_goals
      ELSE m.team_1_goals
    END as opponent_goals
  FROM teams t
  JOIN matches m ON (t.id = m.team_1 OR t.id = m.team_2)
),
team_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    name,
    COUNT(*) as matches,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_goals > opponent_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as victories,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_goals < opponent_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as defeats,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_goals = opponent_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as draws
  FROM team_matches
  GROUP BY id, name
)
SELECT 
  name,
  matches,
  victories,
  defeats,
  draws,
  (victories * 3 + draws * 1) as score
FROM team_stats
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

I've restructured the query to be clearer and avoid potential logic errors:

1. **First CTE (`team_matches`)**: Normalizes the data by creating rows for each team's participation in matches, with `team_goals` and `opponent_goals` properly assigned regardless of whether the team was `team_1` or `team_2`

2. **Second CTE (`team_stats`)**: Calculates statistics based on the normalized data:
   - Victory: when `team_goals > opponent_goals`
   - Defeat: when `team_goals < opponent_goals` 
   - Draw: when `team_goals = opponent_goals`

3. **Final SELECT**: Computes the score and orders by score descending

This approach is more straightforward and less prone to logical errors in the CASE statements. The normalization step ensures we're consistently comparing the team's goals against their opponent's goals, regardless of match position.

`SEP -prompt-`

This markdown table is the expected output: 

## Output Sample

name | matches | victories | defeats | draws | score  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
CEARA | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  
FORTALEZA | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7  
FLORESTA | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3  
GUARANY DE SOBRAL | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0

This is the result your select got:
name        | matches | victories | defeats | draws | score 
-------------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|-------
FORTALEZA         |       3 |         2 |       0 |     1 |     7
CEARA             |       3 |         2 |       0 |     1 |     7
FLORESTA          |       3 |         1 |       2 |     0 |     3
GUARANY DE SOBRAL |       3 |         0 |       3 |     0 |     0

`SEP -response-`

Looking at the results, the statistics are correct but the ordering is wrong. The expected output shows CEARA first, then FORTALEZA, but my query returns FORTALEZA first, then CEARA.

Since both teams have the same score (7 points), I need to add a secondary ordering criterion. Looking at the expected output, it appears the teams should be ordered by name alphabetically when scores are tied.

~ Note this code was copy-pasted by hand from the online visualization of code Claude Sonnet provides. It does not paste code in a markdown code cell by default. ~

```sql
WITH team_matches AS (
  -- Get all matches for each team, normalizing the data
  SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.name,
    CASE 
      WHEN m.team_1 = t.id THEN m.team_1_goals
      ELSE m.team_2_goals
    END as team_goals,
    CASE 
      WHEN m.team_1 = t.id THEN m.team_2_goals
      ELSE m.team_1_goals
    END as opponent_goals
  FROM teams t
  JOIN matches m ON (t.id = m.team_1 OR t.id = m.team_2)
),
team_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    name,
    COUNT(*) as matches,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_goals > opponent_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as victories,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_goals < opponent_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as defeats,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_goals = opponent_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as draws
  FROM team_matches
  GROUP BY id, name
)
SELECT 
  name,
  matches,
  victories,
  defeats,
  draws,
  (victories * 3 + draws * 1) as score
FROM team_stats
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC;
```

The issue was that when teams have the same score, we need a tiebreaker. By adding `name ASC` as a secondary sort criterion, teams with identical scores will be ordered alphabetically. This should match the expected output where CEARA comes before FORTALEZA (both having 7 points).
