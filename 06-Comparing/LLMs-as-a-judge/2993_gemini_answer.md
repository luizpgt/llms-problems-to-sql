An analysis of the two SQL queries to find the most frequent value in a single-column table is presented below.

| Criteria | SQL 1 | SQL 2 | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Correct. | Correct. | **Tie** |
| **Efficiency** | **Winner.** `MODE()` is a built-in aggregate function specifically designed for this purpose and is generally more efficient as the entire operation can be performed in a single pass over the data. | Less efficient. This query requires grouping all data, counting each group, sorting the entire result set of counts, and finally taking the top one. This involves more steps than the direct `MODE()` aggregate. | **SQL 1** |
| **Readability** | **Winner.** The use of `MODE()` is highly declarative and clearly states the intent of finding the statistical mode, making the query very easy to understand at a glance. | Readable, but less direct. A developer needs to read through the `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` clauses to understand that the query is finding the most frequent value. | **SQL 1** |

### **Overall Winner: SQL 1**

While both queries are correct, **SQL 1** is superior. The `MODE()` function is the most appropriate tool for the task, offering better performance and significantly clearer, more expressive code. It directly communicates the query's purpose—to find the statistical mode—which is a best practice in SQL.
