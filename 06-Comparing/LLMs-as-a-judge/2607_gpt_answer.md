Here is the evaluation table for the two SQL queries:

| Criterion       | SQL 1                                            | SQL 2                                               | Verdict                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Correctness** | ✅ Correct (uses `DISTINCT` and correct ordering) | ✅ Correct (default `ASC` is implicit)               | Both correct                       |
| **Efficiency**  | ✅ Fully efficient                                | ✅ Fully efficient (no difference; `ASC` is default) | Tie (identical execution plan)     |
| **Readability** | Slightly more explicit with `ORDER BY city ASC`  | ✅ More concise without unnecessary `ASC`            | SQL 2 is slightly better (cleaner) |

### ✅ **Best Query:** SQL 2

It is equally correct and efficient but slightly more readable by omitting the redundant `ASC` in `ORDER BY`.
