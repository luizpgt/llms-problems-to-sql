Both queries are correct and will produce the identical, correct output. They will also generate the same execution plan in PostgreSQL, making them equally efficient.

The primary difference lies in readability.

| Aspect | SQL 1 | SQL 2 | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | Correct | Correct | Tie |
| **Efficiency** | Excellent | Excellent | Tie |
| **Readability** | **Excellent.** Uses standard formatting conventions (uppercase keywords, indentation) that are easy to read and maintain. | **Good.** More compact, but this style can be harder to read and debug in more complex queries. | **SQL 1** |
| **Verdict** | \- | \- | **SQL 1** is the preferred query. While both are functionally identical, its formatting promotes better readability and long-term maintainability, which are hallmarks of professional SQL code. |
