Both queries are functionally identical and will produce the exact same correct output. They both correctly filter for salaries greater than 3000 and calculate a 10% tax, rounded to two decimal places.

The only difference is the representation of the tax rate (`0.1` vs. `0.10`), which has no impact on the result or performance in PostgreSQL. Therefore, both are equally good solutions.

| Criteria | SQL 1 | SQL 2 | Judgment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Correct | Correct | Tie |
| **Efficiency** | Excellent | Excellent | Tie |
| **Readability** | Excellent | Excellent | Tie |
| **Overall** | - | - | **Tie.** Both queries are perfect solutions. The choice between `0.1` and `0.10` is a minor stylistic preference and has no functional or performance difference. |
