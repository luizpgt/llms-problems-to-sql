Of the two options, SQL 2 is the better query. It is more complete because it includes an `ORDER BY` clause that makes the output match the sample provided.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

| Criterion | SQL 1 | SQL 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | Returns the correct data, but the row order is not guaranteed, unlike the sample output. | **Winner.** Returns the correct data and correctly orders it by the order `id` to match the sample output. |
| **Efficiency** | Very efficient. The `BETWEEN` clause can effectively use an index on `orders_date`. | Nearly identical performance. The `WHERE` clause is functionally the same as `BETWEEN` for the optimizer. The `ORDER BY` adds a necessary sort operation to meet the requirements. |
| **Readability** | Excellent. The use of `BETWEEN` is very clear for date ranges. | Excellent. The logic is clear and well-formatted. |

### Winner: SQL 2

While both queries are highly readable and efficient, **SQL 2 is superior** because it includes `ORDER BY o.id`. This ensures the output is deterministic and exactly matches the format and order of the provided sample, which is a key part of satisfying the problem requirements.
