Here is the evaluation of both SQL queries:

| Aspect          | SQL 1                                                                                                              | SQL 2                                                                                                                          | Verdict        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Correctness** | ✅ Correct. Matches the problem: selects Richards from C774 and C875, computes N, filters correctly.                | ❌ Incorrect filter. `lr.name LIKE '%Richard%'` matches any name *containing* Richard, not necessarily starting with 'Richard'. | **SQL 1 wins** |
| **Precision**   | ✅ Uses `CAST(... AS NUMERIC(10,3))`, ensuring fixed precision.                                                     | ✅ Uses `ROUND(..., 3)`, which is also valid and PostgreSQL-friendly for decimal rounding.                                      | Tie            |
| **Efficiency**  | ✅ Slightly more efficient filter with `LIKE 'Richard%'` since it uses an index if available (no leading wildcard). | ❌ Less efficient due to `LIKE '%Richard%'` — leading wildcard disables index usage.                                            | **SQL 1 wins** |
| **Readability** | ✅ Clear aliasing, explicit `JOIN`, precise formatting, order by omega explicitly.                                  | ✅ Also clear, uses `INNER JOIN` (same as `JOIN`), but the incorrect pattern in `LIKE` harms semantic clarity.                  | SQL 1 better   |

### ✅ **Conclusion: SQL 1 is the most correct, efficient, and readable query.**
