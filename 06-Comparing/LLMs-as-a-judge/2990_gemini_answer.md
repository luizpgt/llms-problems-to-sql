### Evaluation

| Criteria | SQL 1 | SQL 2 | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | Correct | Correct | **Tie** |
| **Efficiency** | **Winner**. The `LEFT JOIN` with a `WHERE ... IS NULL` check is generally more performant in PostgreSQL. It allows the query planner to use more efficient join strategies like an anti-join. | The `NOT IN` clause can be less efficient, especially on large tables, as it may involve scanning the subquery's results multiple times. While PostgreSQL has improved its handling of `NOT IN`, `JOIN` is often the more optimizable approach. | **SQL 1** |
| **Readability** | **Winner**. The `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` pattern is a very common and idiomatic way to find rows in one table that do not have a corresponding row in another. It's clear and unambiguous. | `NOT IN` is also readable, but it carries a potential pitfall: if the subquery returns any `NULL` values, `NOT IN` will not match any rows, leading to incorrect results. The query correctly guards against this with `WHERE cpf_emp IS NOT NULL`, but this makes it slightly less concise and requires extra care. | **SQL 1** |

### **Overall Winner: SQL 1**
