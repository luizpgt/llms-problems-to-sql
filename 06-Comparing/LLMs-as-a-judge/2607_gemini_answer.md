Both queries are correct and will produce the identical, correct output. However, one is slightly better from a code style and readability perspective.

| Criterion | SQL 1 | SQL 2 | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | ✅ Correct | ✅ Correct | Tie |
| **Efficiency** | ✅ Identical Performance | ✅ Identical Performance | Tie |
| **Readability** | ⭐ **Slightly Better** | ✅ Good | **SQL 1** |
| **Overall** | | | **🏆 SQL 1** |
| **Reasoning** | SQL 1 is marginally better as it is more explicit. Specifying `ASC` in the `ORDER BY` clause makes the query's intention immediately clear to any developer, regardless of their expertise. While omitting `ASC` is valid because it's the default sort order, being explicit is a widely-accepted best practice for long-term code clarity and maintainability. |
