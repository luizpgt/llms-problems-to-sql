Both SQL queries are **functionally identical**, producing the correct output with the same execution plan, since they both:

* Use an inner join with the correct key (`m.id_prices = p.id`).
* Apply the correct filter (`p.value < 2.00`).
* Select the correct columns (`m.id`, `m.name`).

The only difference is formatting: SQL 1 uses line breaks and explicit `AS` for aliasing; SQL 2 is more compact and omits `AS`.

| 👀 Readability | ✅ Clear, more readable for longer queries | ⚠️ Compact but less readable in complex | **SQL 1 is better** |

### ✅ **SQL 1 is the most correct, efficient, and readable.**
