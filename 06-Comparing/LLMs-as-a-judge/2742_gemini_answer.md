Of the two SQL queries provided, the first one is the better choice.

| Category | Winner | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | SQL 1 | The `LIKE 'Richard%'` pattern is a more accurate interpretation of the requirement to find names that are "Richard" than SQL 2's `LIKE '%Richard%'`, which would incorrectly match names where "Richard" appears in the middle or at the end. |
| **Efficiency** | SQL 1 | More efficient. The pattern `LIKE 'Richard%'` can effectively use an index on the `name` column if one exists. SQL 2's leading wildcard in `LIKE '%Richard%'` prevents the use of a standard index, which would lead to a full table scan and be significantly slower on large tables. |
| **Readability** | Tie | Both queries are clean, well-aliased, and easy to follow. Minor differences like `JOIN` vs. `INNER JOIN` are stylistic and do not significantly impact readability. |
| **Overall** | **SQL 1** | **SQL 1 is the better query due to its higher precision and superior performance potential.** |
