Here is the evaluation of both SQL queries based on correctness, efficiency, and readability:

| Aspect           | SQL 1                                                                        | SQL 2                                                                                                                                       | Verdict                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Correctness**  | ‚úÖ Correct, produces accurate results.                                        | ‚úÖ Correct, produces accurate results.                                                                                                       | **Tie**                            |
| **Efficiency**   | ‚úÖ Efficient: processes matches only once per team via two UNION ALL scans.   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly less efficient: uses `JOIN` between `teams` and `matches`, producing a larger intermediate table (Cartesian-style for matches). | **SQL 1 wins**                     |
| **Readability**  | ‚úÖ Clean separation of responsibilities (all matches ‚Üí stats ‚Üí final result). | ‚úÖ Clear structure but with nested CASE statements inside the FROM clause, making it a bit more verbose.                                     | **SQL 1 slightly better**          |
| **Style/Extras** | ‚úÖ Straightforward ORDER BY on `score DESC`.                                  | ‚úÖ Adds tie-breaking with `ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC` (a small bonus for determinism).                                                   | Minor bonus to SQL 2 on tie-break. |

### üî• **Winner: SQL 1**

* SQL 1 is **more efficient**, **cleaner**, and separates concerns better: first normalizes the data (`all_team_matches`), then aggregates (`team_stats`), then presents.
* SQL 2 is also correct and clear but incurs a slight performance cost due to the join on `teams` with `matches`. It does offer deterministic ordering with name as a tie-breaker, which could be valuable depending on the context.

If you want, I can show how to merge the best of both queries into an ideal one.
