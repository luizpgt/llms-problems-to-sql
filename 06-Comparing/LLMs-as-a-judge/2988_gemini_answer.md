Of the two queries, the first one is marginally better due to its improved readability and potentially better performance on larger datasets.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the comparison:

| Aspect | SQL 1 | SQL 2 | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | Correct. It accurately calculates all required statistics. | Correct. It also calculates all statistics accurately and adds a helpful secondary sort for tie-breaking. | **SQL 2** (Slightly) |
| **Efficiency** | Good. The `UNION ALL` approach is explicit and generally performs well. It scans the `matches` table twice, but the operations are simple, allowing the query planner to optimize them easily. This pattern is often more scalable than using `OR` in a join condition. | Good. This approach joins the tables only once. However, using `OR` in a `JOIN` condition can sometimes be less efficient for the database's query planner on very large tables compared to a `UNION ALL`. | **SQL 1** |
| **Readability**| Excellent. It uses two CTEs that break the problem into clear, logical steps: first, normalize the data into a list of results for each team; second, calculate statistics. The logic is very easy to follow. | Good. The logic is more compact, but the `JOIN` with an `OR` condition combined with multiple `CASE` statements inside a single CTE makes it slightly denser and harder to read at a glance. | **SQL 1** |

### Conclusion

**SQL 1 is the better query.**

While both queries are correct, **SQL 1** wins on readability and standard practice for efficiency. Its step-by-step approach using `UNION ALL` is a very common and explicit pattern for this type of data transformation, making the code easier to maintain. This structure is often more predictable for the query optimizer, leading to better performance on larger datasets.
