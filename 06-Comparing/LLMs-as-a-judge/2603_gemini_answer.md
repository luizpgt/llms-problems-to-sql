Both queries are correct and will produce the identical, correct output. In terms of performance, PostgreSQL will treat both queries exactly the same, resulting in identical execution plans.

The primary difference lies in readability and coding style.

| **Criteria** | **SQL 1** | **SQL 2** | **Winner** | **Justification** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | Correct | Correct | **Tie** | Both queries correctly filter for customers in 'Porto Alegre' and select the required columns. |
| **Efficiency** | Excellent | Excellent | **Tie** | Formatting differences (like line breaks and indentation) do not affect the query's execution plan or performance in PostgreSQL. |
| **Readability** | **Excellent** | Good | **SQL 1** | SQL 1 follows a standard, more structured formatting convention. Separating clauses (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) and columns onto different lines significantly improves readability, especially as queries become more complex. This is a widely accepted best practice. |

### **Overall Winner: SQL 1**

While both queries are functionally identical, **SQL 1** is superior due to its enhanced readability and adherence to common SQL formatting standards. This style makes the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
