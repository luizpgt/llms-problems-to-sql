Here is the concise evaluation table comparing the two SQL queries:

| Aspect          | SQL 1                                                                               | SQL 2                                                                                         | Verdict               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Correctness** | ✅ Correct                                                                           | ✅ Correct                                                                                     | Both correct          |
| **Efficiency**  | ✅ More efficient — uses `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL`, avoids subquery and deduplication. | ⚠️ Less efficient — `NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT ...)` can be slower, especially with large data. | SQL 1 wins            |
| **Readability** | ✅ Very readable — clear joins and simple `WHERE` clause.                            | ⚠️ Slightly less readable — nested subquery adds complexity.                                  | SQL 1 slightly better |

### ✅ **SQL 1 is preferred** — it is **more efficient** and **more readable**, while both are functionally correct.
