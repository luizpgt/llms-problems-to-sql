You are a PostgreSQL SQL expert tasked with judging competitive SQL query answers with PostgreSQL. I will provide you with the following information for each problem:

* A short **problem description** explaining what to achieve.
* The **database schema** with table names, column names, and their data types.
* Example **table data** with some rows.
* The expected **output format/sample**.
* Two SQL queries that that satisfies the problem requirements and matches the output format.

Your goal is to tell which is the most **correct, efficient, and readable SQL query**.
